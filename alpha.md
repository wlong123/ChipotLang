Blog Post
We’re also asking you to put together a brief blog post for the whole class to read. This post can be as short as a few hundred words. It should be written for a general audience familiar with CS 4110-style material. You may include accompanying graphics if helpful. Your blog post should cover:

Vision: What are you trying to achieve? It’s fine to re-use text from your project report if helpful, but remember you are writing for a general audience, not the course staff!

Status: What’s the status of your current prototype? Showing some test cases or a screenshot might be helpful.

Next steps: What do you plan to do next?

You should format your blog post in Jekyll-flavored Markdown and submit a Zip file named blog.zip on CMS that contains a file alpha.md with your blog post, along with any other supporting files (e.g., images).
